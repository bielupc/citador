# Citador

Simple quoting web app developed with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) for automating the citation of references for my highschool research project. 


## üîç About

The main idea behind this app was to automate the task of referencing all the sources of information used in my high school research project about [Machine Learning](https://github.com/BielAltimira/price-prediction), difficult due to its repetitiveness and specificity of the criteria required to meet. I also took the change to test my Web Dev skills in Python and decided to deploy the app for other students to use the tool.

## üèóÔ∏è Deployment

This project was deployed using [PythonAnywhere](http://violoncel.pythonanywhere.com/). The website might not be available if not used regularly, so feel free to contact if redeployment is needed or try to test the code by yourself using the following section.
## üî® Installation

The project can be ran and inspected locally by installing all the necesary requirements from the `requirements.txt` file provided, which can install all the required packages into your current environment using: 

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
